        <h1 id="title">Finding the elusive passwords for Everybody's Golf (PAL, PS2)</h1>
        <p><strong>Cheatcodes are at the bottom of this page, but you'd better believe I'm not going to let you go
                without a technical writeup!</strong></p>
        <h1 id="what-is-this">What is this?</h1>
        <p>Everybody's Golf (Hot Shots Golf in the NTSC-U region) was a series of golf games that ranged from the
            PS1-PS4 region.</p>
        <p>so, for clarification's sake, there are three different games called Everybody's Golf. One of them is the PAL
            counterpart of the PS2 game known in the US as Hot Shots Golf Fore! That's the game this writeup is about.
        </p>
        <h1 id="why">Why?</h1>
        <p>good question</p>
        <p>the original motivation was simply the fact that the information wasn't readily available anywhere, and i'm
            not sure if <em>anyone</em> has it anymore. it was my first time reverse engineering a PS2 game, and it was
            <em>just</em> slippery enough to be entertaining to dig through.
        </p>
        <h1 id="how">How?</h1>
        <p>First of all I want to thank the developers of PCSX2 who helped make key improvements to the emulator's
            built-in debugger. In particular, thanks to F0bes for working to <a
                href="https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2/pull/4974">implement memory search functionality in the
                emulator</a>. Emulator development is often a thankless job, and they don't get the credit they deserve.
        </p>
        <p>Key tools were:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A recent version of <a href="https://pcsx2.net/">PCSX2</a>. (As of 2022-06-14 only the WXWidgets variant
                of PCSX2 contains the debugger GUI)</li>
            <li><a href="https://ghidra-sre.org/">Ghidra</a>, the free and open source decompiler.</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/beardypig/ghidra-emotionengine">Ghidra-EmotionEngine</a></li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="technobabble-ahead">Technobabble ahead</h2>
        <p>In case you've never played the game, passwords (in the PAL/NTSC-U versions) are six character strings of
            letters ranging from A-Z. Interestingly the NTSC-J version of this game doesn't use A-Z, instead opting for
            Japanese characters. (no way this would come into play... right? :P )</p>
        <p>Early attempts involved searching the binaries with regular expressions to find anything that resembled a
            cheat code. In particular, I was hoping to find many code-like strings adjacent to one another. I even went
            as far as dumping the memory of the emulated system in case they were part of a compressed block of data
            on-disc.</p>
        <p>After that approach yielded nothing, I tried to find where the cheat code was actually being stored in
            memory, again to no avail--it clearly wasn't being stored in either Ascii/UTF8 or UTF-16. After a while I
            broke out Cheat Engine, and did a search for an unknown byte value. This led me to the password entered in
            memory, which for some odd reason was being mapped to values ranging from 0x20 to 0x39. What's weirder?
            These values were being used as indices into some sort of lookup table I didn't yet understand. At this
            point, it was clearly time to bring out the big guns, so I busted out Ghidra.</p>
        <p>Something weird about this game is that its code is split up into several binaries which are all stored in
            separate files on the disc. If you open up an individual file, you'll quickly notice a large number of
            global references--functions, pointers, and raw data. That's normal. What's not normal is that the
            references themselves appear to be nonsense.</p>
        <p>Turns out that, despite the game code being spread through multiple files, all of the files reference data
            within each other, and make calls directly to each other. It's not quite static linking, not quite dynamic
            linking. I don't know enough to have a good guess on why this is. Apparently, on boot, the game loads all of
            its code files into the exact same regions of memory, making the global references line up consistently. The
            files didn't match 1:1 with the target memory in many areas, and rather than spend the time reverse
            engineering the reasons behind that, I just ripped out the memory from a savestate and opened <em>that</em>
            in Ghidra instead. It disassembled just fine and left me with a perfectly usable workspace.</p>
        <p>With the game disassembled and decompiled, I was able to start tracking the workflow more. I hit some major
            stumbling blocks at several points, and learned a very important lesson about reverse engineering binaries:
            <strong>If the decompilation makes no sense, read the assembly first.</strong> The PS2 has a MIPS
            instruction called psubb. This takes two 128-bit registers, and performs 16 parallel subtractions--the bytes
            don't carry from one another, etc. This came up often in stdlib-ish functions like strcpy, strcmp, and
            strlen, which use large-register functions when possible to parallelize the process. Due to the fact that
            Ghidra had no way to express this function succinctly, it exploded into about <em>twenty lines</em> of
            unreadable shifts, concatenations, and byte splitting. I would have also been saved from the confusion had I
            figured out sooner that the &quot;nonsense&quot; code was being guarded by alignment checks. Life moves on.
        </p>
        <p>My first major advancement came when I was able to disassemble the function that was performing the lookup
            table transformation for passwords. I took a closer look at the table being used, and took a wild
            guess--this is a Japanese game from 2005, what if it's Shift-JIS?</p>
        <p>Jackpot. The passwords were being transformed into the Romanji equivalents of the original characters input
            by the user. This doesn't aid in the password logic in any way, and most English in the game uses
            single-byte characters... It makes sense for the Japanese version to use Shift-JIS, but due to how the
            password codes are set up, there's no restriction or need for a specific character encoding. Maybe it made
            sense in the original codebase--it's impossible for me to see the preprocessor directives, after all.</p>
        <p>After figuring out that the strcpy and strlen functions were, uh, themselves, I quickly spotted something
            interesting: A block of code where the password was being compared to a constant string, PALEBG. Was it a
            cheat code? Nope. In fact, once I finished labeling and reversing, I found out the code calling the strcmp
            should <em>never</em> get hit. Forcing the branch to be taken with a nop had no notable effect, either. Was
            this a troll password from the developers, or testing code left in the game? I choose to believe it's the
            former, because it's more funny that way.</p>
        <p>My next breakthrough was figuring out the code path responsible for giving the user the &quot;The password
            entered was incorrect&quot; message. The method for processing cheats had a very complicated control flow
            when disassembled (several gotos, multiple while loops and tracking variables), and this was a nice anchor
            to reason around.</p>
        <p>As I went on, I started to make some deductions about the actual control flow. I found the codepath for
            correct passwords and worked backwards from there, leading me to a giant block of nonsense multiplications
            against random numbers, arbitrary bitshifts, confusing conditions, all wrapped up in a loop. Sight-reading
            the code, I was fearing at first that this was an attempt at control flow obfuscation, which I know from
            experience can take an annoyingly long time to undo. I was very relieved when I saw the loop condition and
            realized it only ran for six iterations at most--the length of the password.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, what I found is that the passwords are <em>not</em> stored in memory, nor on disc. Instead, they
            are <strong>procedurally generated</strong> by the nonsense math, which generates one character at a time,
            compares the current character in the password to it, and repeats until the password is or isn't valid. It
            then repeats this process for each potential password that can be generated. It seeds this process by
            pulling a 16-bit value from a constant table of 101 entries stored in memory, and ends when it sees null
            bytes.</p>
        <p>Each entry in the table is 8 bytes long. The first 4 bits describe the (2-byte) seed, and the next 4 describe
            what that cheat should do or unlock.</p>
        <p>Armed with this knowledge, I ripped the decompiled &quot;scrambler&quot; code out and pasted it into my IDE,
            provided it all the seeds, fixed the compile errors, and was able to generate the table presented below.</p>
        <p>Phew.</p>
        <h1 id="the-codes">The Codes</h1>
        <p>Thanks for reading everything above. (you'd never dare to just scroll by everything else without saying
            howdy, wouldya?)</p>
        <p>Here's all the codes I believe the game has. I documented them by hand because Ghidra was starting to hurt my
            eyes. Note that, as far as equipment, clubs, courses, and outfits, <strong>these codes only make those items
                <em>available to unlock</em> in the ingame shop</strong>. If you don't want to earn the points you'll
            need to actually hack.</p>
        <p>Several of these codes are marked ???. They <em>are</em> valid codes recognized by the game, but they won't
            unlock unless you've already got something else unlocked (I started from a clean save). Feel free to make a
            pull request if you decide to document anything I haven't.</p>
